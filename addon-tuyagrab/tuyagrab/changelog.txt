0.1 Simple way of outputting all Tuya Devices to a URL on Hass
0.2 outputs to both the log and also a local file
0.3 Added controllable auto shutdown time + allowed people to change refresh time.
0.4 Used wrong shutdown command for Alpine, changed and updated.
0.5 added schema
0.6 taken away the file going into www/local as it was insecure. Now just outputs to the log + stores in a file within /config
0.7 Removed versions from packages.
0.8 Really poorly coded changes to get the txt file to generate.
