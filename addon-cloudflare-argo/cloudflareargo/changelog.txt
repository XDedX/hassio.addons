0.1 hacky mess!
0.2 Now able to bring up a network and keep it going based on settings within the hassos config.
0.3 Now able to bring up 3 tunnels in total and ignores 2 and 3 if they are not set within config. Put a delay on tunnels being brought up so that services have time to come online, this is hacky but not sure how to wait for an external port.
0.4 Certificates are now defined within the config for all tunnels, changed haurl value to just be "url" as people may not just be using this for home assistant (For example the unifi addon could be exposed).
0.5 tried adding url verification, but it didnt work well.
0.6 using cloudflared to check the connection works much better and is now setup.
0.7 added readme for Hassos
0.8 Went to ARM64 and found that wasnt working. Added if statement so it works
0.9 (future) I need to figure out a way of stopping the tunnel failing (sleep) after a reboot / power outage
1.0 No need to do 0.9 as the new cloudflared handles this.
1.1 Convert to alpine
1.2 updated Arm64 github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/download/2021.1.5/cloudflared-linux-arm64 version
1.3 changed over to #!/usr/bin/env bashio and then changed back!
1.4 added schema to solve problem with addon config
1.5 Fixed services continuing to run when argo2 and argo3 tunnels didn't exist
1.6 Certificate Fix for Tunnel 2 and 3
1.7 Updated file that ARM64 downloads so its always the latest version
2.0 Change away from Legacy Argo, Unfortunately that means lots of breaking changes.
