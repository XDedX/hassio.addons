# If you need to run any additional commands or adjust the environment, you can do so here.
# For example, setting environment variables or user permissions.

# No need for a run.sh script if the container's default command works for you. 
# If you need one for some reason, you can add:
# COPY run.sh /
# RUN chmod a+x /run.sh
# CMD [ "/run.sh" ]

# However, since the Docker image already has its CMD set, we'll leave these commented out.
